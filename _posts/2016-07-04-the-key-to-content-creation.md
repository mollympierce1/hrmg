# Storytelling: The Key to Content Creation

As an engagement officer for TAMU-CC, part of my responsibility is to facilitate the online presence of the [Islander Alumni Association](http://www.islanderalumni.org), which includes social media and website updates. To accomplish this task, it is important for me to understand how social media will support the goals of the organization which are: furthering the alumni brand, engaging with alumni and students, and promoting a lifelong relationship between [Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi](https://www.tamucc.edu) and its growing number of alumni. Most people maintain a personal profile on at least one major networking platform such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, and are a great way for people to express their individuality and share their life with friends and family. This is no different for a business or organization. Social media networks are now the go-to platforms for many businesses and organizations to connect with their audience and promote their brands; however, there is much more to managing a successful social media platform for a business or organization.

A good foundation to support these goals is to have a great a content strategy. Everyone has a different approach when it comes to creating engaging content, but one of the most effective ways is to tell a story. A great story is short and to the point and often includes various characters that take on different roles. A great story also has elements of emotion, tension, and overcoming obstacles. Creating content for the Islander Alumni Association's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/islanderalumni) is no different. We have various events that happen throughout the year and we create our social media content accordingly. For example, during the weeks leading up to homecoming, we focus on the history of our university and create engaging content by hosting online photo sharing events, contests, upcoming events and videos. In general, the most specific you can get with your content plan, the more effective you’ll be in its implementation. This is why content planning is essential to your online success, so it is good practice to spend the time creating the content. Consider having the following procedures in place when planning and publishing content:

*   Establish policies
*   Creation procedures
*   Content framework/matrix
*   Calendar creation
*   Editorial approval
*   Publishing procedures

Therefore, every action you take online, whether it be a business website or social network, is part of a telling your organization’s story. Your content should be guided by a plan that will help reach pre-determined goals.
