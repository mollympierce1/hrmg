Located in Kingsville, Texas, The Tanning Bar is a fresh and modern take on tanning salons in south Texas. Offering state of the art UV beds, Norvell spray tans and a growing range of other products, The Tanning Bar was in search of a clean modern web presence that represented the overall business aesthetic. HRMG captured high-quality photography on-site of customers utilizing the beds and spray tan services to deliver the highest caliber website design possible. After careful consideration and research were conducted, a modernized sidebar navigation solution was selected to achieve an optimal user experience.
