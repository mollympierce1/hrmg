Working closely with Bay’s marketing director, our creative team has helped refine Bay Ltd.’s image and branding in a number of ways, including photographing and updating employee headshots, and designing and producing new business cards, recruitment posters, career brochures, and a complete family of brochures advertising Bay Ltd.’s service areas including crane and heavy haul, industrial services, industrial fabrication, and others. Original articles and press releases have also been produced to keep the public updated on company news and information as well as to help boost the website’s optimization. Other creative projects have included custom designed print advertisements, worksite banners, location signage, decals and water bottle labels.

As one of our largest projects to date in a brand new industry, the team at HRMG was excited to learn about the ins and outs of industrial construction and fabrication. As we attended orientation meetings, interview sessions with staff and even underwent safety training, it was clear that Bay Ltd. was a company of family and friends who were committed to excellence in all aspects of their operations. Translating this unique culture of safety, quality and caring visually would be paramount as well as building on its impressive 60-year legacy to propel the business into an even greater future.

Though Bay Ltd. is one of the largest industrial full-service industrial construction and fabrication providers in the nation and is continually recognized for its safety performance, its online presence was minimal. The previous website was in need of complete upgrades and overhauls involving content, design, functionality and security. Our approach was to create a site that not only raised awareness regarding Bay Ltd. and its wide-range of comprehensive services, but also to help create a distinctive brand identity, improve user experience, enhance security and attract new visitors while retaining existing ones.
