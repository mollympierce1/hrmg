We partnered with WaterStreet Market to revamp the Oyster Bar Menus. They were looking to shift the branding of their three different restaurant concepts according to their individual schemes and environments. We reworked the Oyster Bar logo as a throwback to the “Oyster O” they used when the restaurant first opened. The new menus complete the Oyster Bar dining experience – a sleek, industrial, Corpus Christi staple.
