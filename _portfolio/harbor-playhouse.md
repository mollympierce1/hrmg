We teamed up with the Harbor Playhouse to help make their 90th season a little extra special. Boxes and boxes of old photos have been collecting dust over the years, and we thought it was time to dust some of them off and honor the generations of volunteers that have made their mark on the community theater.

We built a responsive, one-page website to feature some old memories, as well as to engage with the community in collecting memories of their own. The website, along with a print mailer campaign and social efforts, are being used to get audiences excited about the anniversary season, and to test how quality design drives sales.
